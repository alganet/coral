coral — a contemporary shell script system
------------------------------------------

👷🏗🚧 Under Construction 🏗🚧👷

---

This is a long-term research project to revamp the shell script ecosystem.

Goals:

 - Make shell familiar to web developers with libraries, a sensible style
   guide and supporting tools.
 - Test and document everything carefully.
 - Be shell agnostic (bash, zsh, dash, it doesn't matter).

What is done:

 - [Previous proof of concept](https://github.com/Mosai/workshop).
 - A new module loader that supports circular dependencies, hooks and multiple
   paths (See the require.sh file).
 - [Research on native JSON and structuring support](https://gist.github.com/alganet/143cf0d2fbdc2a3493ae2f8b60e0fe85)
 - [Research on prefix-notation based syntax](https://gist.github.com/alganet/537cd770e31ce41ac20129f7f90c08aa)
