**We want the shell to be great for developers**, so we built:

 - The `require.sh` module loader and [useful reusable modules][Modules].
 - Support for bash, zsh, dash and [many others, in many OSs][Support].
 - An [executable documentation][Literate] to document and test everything.

It turns the shell into a modern, robust platform for writing software.

[Support]: spec/support.md
[Modules]: spec/modules.md
[Literate]: spec/literate.md
