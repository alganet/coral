🐚 coral — a portable shell script ecosystem
===========================================

👷🏗🚧 Under Construction 🏗🚧👷

---

This is a long-term research project to revamp the shell script ecosystem.

Goals:

 - **Make shell scripting a familiar choice by providing libraries, a sensible
   style guide and supporting tools**.
 - Test and document everything carefully.
 - Be shell agnostic (bash, zsh, dash, it doesn't matter).
